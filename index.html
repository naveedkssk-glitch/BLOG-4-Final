    <p>She added that multiple complaints had been received from the public regarding forced land occupations by scheme operators, and warned that strong action would be taken against those involved.</p>
    <p>The RDA also regularly issues public notices, urging people not to invest in unauthorized schemes. Citizens are advised to verify the legal status of any project through the official <a href="https://rda.gop.pk/" target="_blank">RDA website</a> and deal only with approved housing societies.</p>
    <p>Officials noted that warnings had already been issued to the schemeâ€™s sponsors to stop illegal advertisements, bookings, and development work. However, despite these notices, the owners continued to operate booking offices in violation of the law.</p>
    <p>The latest operation was carried out by RDA officers, including Assistant Director Building Control Shiza Butt, Assistant Directors Planning Ali Raza, Mehwish Naseem, and Ahmad Hassan, along with other staff members. Police from the New Airport Islamabad Police Station provided support during the action.</p>
